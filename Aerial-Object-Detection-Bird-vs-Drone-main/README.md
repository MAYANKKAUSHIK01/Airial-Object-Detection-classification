# Aerial Object Classification & Detection

Deep Learning–based Bird vs Drone classification and optional YOLOv11 object detection.

## Overview
This project aims to identify aerial objects (Bird or Drone) using image classification and real-time detection. It uses a custom CNN, transfer learning models, and optionally YOLOv11. A Streamlit app is included for deployment.

## Features
- Image classification (Bird vs Drone)
- YOLOv11 object detection (optional)
- Data preprocessing & augmentation
- Streamlit UI for deployment

## Skills Learned
- Deep Learning  
- Computer Vision  
- Image Classification & Detection  
- TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch  
- YOLOv11  
- Streamlit

## Methodology
### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Image cleaning  
- Augmentation (flip, rotation, brightness, zoom)

### 2. **Modeling**
- Custom CNN  
- Transfer learning (MobileNet, ResNet, EfficientNet)  
- YOLOv11 detection (optional)

### 3. **Evaluation**
- Accuracy, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Sample prediction visualization  

### 4. **Deployment**
Streamlit dashboard for easy use.
